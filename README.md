# Intention-for-Airbnb-Analysis
The growing potential of the sharing economy along with the consumers tendency to engage in peer-to-peer accommodation has set a ground for this research, which is to analyze the future prospect of accommodation sharing in the context of Vietnam. 

In order to examine the influence of socio-cultural factors on Vietnamese’ consumers behavioral intentions to use P2P accommodation such as Airbnb, the research framework is developed based on two main theories, which are Hofstede’s cultural dimension theory and Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Essentially, TPB is implemented to determine the effects of “Attitude towards using Airbnb” and “Subjective norms” on “Behavioral intention in using Airbnb”. 
As the research focuses on the Vietnamese consumers only, the cultural values are denoted as: Collectivism, Femininity,  Low Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-term Orientation, Restraint (Hofstede, 2021). The study also aims at discovering the influences of subjective norms or social factors on consumer’s intention. In this research, another layer of subjective norm, represented by eWOM, is implemented to further analyze social factors besides cultural ones. Regarding the term Word-of-mouth (WOM), it refers to personal conversations among consumers about products or services (Sen and Lerman, 2007).
